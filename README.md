# ALGO alias

A chrome extension that lets you add aliases to [AlgoExplorer](https://algoexplorer.io/).

Turn an address like "7BZEUIEPHZGDK6E673DVOY6BVCCZC6YFAJ3QWROPBZK5XKGE5GUWDYZRUY" into "My Wallet".

or an application ID like "Application 465818260" into "Algofi Manager App"

or application args like "dXA=" into "update prices"

Before:

After:

## Usage

![example aliases](examples/example.png)

Each line in the text box represents an alias. The first value is the text
you want to replace, the second value is the alias to display.

You can replace any text on the page, think of it as a global find and replace.

See the [example aliases](examples/aliases.txt)
